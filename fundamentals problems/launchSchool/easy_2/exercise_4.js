Fibonacci Number Location by Length

The Fibonacci series is a series of numbers (1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, ...) such
that the first two numbers are 1 by definition, and each subsequent number is 
the sum of the two previous numbers. Fibonacci numbers often appear in mathematics
and nature.

Computationally, the Fibonacci series is a simple series, but the results grow
at an incredibly rapid rate. For example, the 100th Fibonacci number is
354,224,848,179,261,915,075â€”that's enormous, especially considering that it takes
six iterations just to find the first 2-digit Fibonacci number.

Write a function that calculates and returns the index of the first Fibonacci 
number that has the number of digits specified by the argument. (The first 
Fibonacci number has an index of 1.)

You may assume that the argument is always an integer greater than or equal to 2.

JavaScript's normal Number type can represent integers accurate up to the value
of Number.MAX_SAFE_INTEGER, which is the 16-digit value 9007199254740991. Any
integer larger than that value loses accuracy. For instance, the following code
outputs 1, not 2 as you may expect:

console.log(Number.MAX_SAFE_INTEGER + 2 - Number.MAX_SAFE_INTEGER);

We'll be working with much larger numbers in this problem. Fortuanately, JavaScript
now supports a BigInt type that lets you work with massive integers, limited only
by the amount of memory available to your program, and the time you can devote to
waiting for an answer.

To use BigInt integers in your solution, simply append the letter n to any numbers
you use in your solution: 1n, 1234567890123456789012345678901234567890n, and so on. 
JavaScript will take care of the rest. */

console.log(findFibonacciIndexByLength(2n) === 7n);    // 1 1 2 3 5 8 13
console.log(findFibonacciIndexByLength(3n) === 12n);   // 1 1 2 3 5 8 13 21 34 55 89 144
console.log(findFibonacciIndexByLength(10n) === 45n);
console.log(findFibonacciIndexByLength(16n) === 74n);
console.log(findFibonacciIndexByLength(100n) === 476n);
console.log(findFibonacciIndexByLength(1000n) === 4782n);
console.log(findFibonacciIndexByLength(10000n) === 47847n);

// The last example may take a minute or so to run.

/* Algorithm
  - declare two variables num1 and num2 and assign 1 to each
  - declare variable fibIndex and assign to 0
  - conditon: return index number when number of digits in the current fib equals
              the passed in argument

/* (book)

function findFibonacciIndexByLength(length) {
  let first = 1n;
  let second = 1n;
  let count = 2n;
  let fibonacci;

  do {
    fibonacci = first + second;
    count += 1n;
    first = second;
    second = fibonacci;
  } while (String(fibonacci).length < length);

  return count;
}

Discussion

The function starts by initializating the first two numbers in the Fibonacci 
sequence, both of which are 1n. We use the count variable to keep track of where
we are in the sequence -- the value of second is the second Fibonacci number, so
our count is initially 2n.

The solution then uses a do...while loop to calculate the value of each subsequent
Fibonacci number while the length of the number is is less than the value of the
value of the length argument. At every iteration the solution does the following:

- Computes the value for fibonacci by adding up the first and second values.

- Increments count by 1n. It returns the value of count if the corresponding
Fibonacci number is greater than or equal to the desired length.

- Sets the value of first to the value of second, and the value of second to the
value of fibonacci. If the criteria for stopping the loop isn't met at the end
of this iteration, it uses the two numbers for the computation of fibonacci in the
next iteration.
