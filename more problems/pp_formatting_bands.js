Practice Problem: Formatting Bands

We have the following Array of information for some popular bands:

let bands = [
  { name: 'sunset rubdown', country: 'UK', active: false },
  { name: 'women', country: 'Germany', active: false },
  { name: 'a silver mt. zion', country: 'Spain', active: true },
];

There are problems with this data, though, so we first have to clean it up
before we can use it:

- The band countries are wrong: all the bands should have 'Canada' as the
  country.
- The band name should have all words capitalized.
- Remove all dots from the band names.

Write a function that can process the input band Array and return an Array
that contains the fixed information: */

let bands = [
  { name: 'sunset rubdown', country: 'UK', active: false },
  { name: 'women', country: 'Germany', active: false },
  { name: 'a silver mt. zion', country: 'Spain', active: true },
];

function processBands(data) {
  return data.map(band => {
    updateCountry(band);
    removeDots(band);
    capitalizeName(band);
    return band;
  });
}

function updateCountry(obj) {
  obj.country = 'Canada';
}

function removeDots(obj) {
  obj.name = obj.name.replace('.', '');
}

function capitalizeName(obj) {
  obj.name = obj.name.split(' ').map(str => {
    return str[0].toUpperCase() + str.slice(1);
  }).join(' ');
}

console.log(processBands(bands));

/* should return:

[
  { name: 'Sunset Rubdown', country: 'Canada', active: false },
  { name: 'Women', country: 'Canada', active: false },
  { name: 'A Silver Mt Zion', country: 'Canada', active: true },
]

*/

/* algorithm:
  - iterate through (bands)
    - element.country = 'Canada'
    - element.name replace . with ''
    - element.name str[0].toUpperCase() + str.slice(1)
  - return bands
*/

/* book solution

Our solution works, but every step along the way produces side effects.
Specifically, this process mutates the original bands Array, and each of the
transformative functions works on different content. If you no longer need
the original bands data, this may be OK, but it can cause problems if you
don't expect the mutation. Generally, you should aim to reduce side effects
in your functions; this contains the effects on the rest of your program.

A version of this program that is free from side effects may look like this:

Copy Code
function processBands(bands) {
  return bands.map(band => {
    let capitalizedName = capitalizePhrase(band.name);
    let newBandName = removeDotsInString(capitalizedName);

    return {
      name: newBandName,
      country: 'Canada',
      active: band.active,
    };
  });
}

function capitalizePhrase(phrase) {
  return phrase.split(' ')
               .map(word => capitalizeString(word))
               .join(' ');
}

function capitalizeString(string) {
  let initial = string[0].toUpperCase();
  let rest = string.slice(1, string.length);
  return initial + rest;
}

function removeDotsInString(string) {
  return string.replace(/\./g, '');
}

This is also a better solution as an abstraction â€“ the concept of a band
doesn't leak into the capitalizePhrase and removeDotsInString functions.
Instead, it merely performs string operations, and doesn't care what its
arguments represent. */
